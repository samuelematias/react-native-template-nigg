```

- **src** - Directory containing all the application files, a `src` directory is created so that the application code can be isolated in one directory and easily ported to other projects, if necessary;

  - **assets** - Directory for saving all file types, related to assets (Ex: images, fonts, etc ...);

    - **images** - Directory to store all kinds of images;

      - **logo.png** - A image example;

  - **common** - Directory to store every file type that is generic, files that are used in more than one feature;

    - **components** - Directory for storing components that are generic, components that are used in more than one feature;

      - **Button.js** - File where all Button component logic will be made;

      - **index.js** - File where the components will be indexed;

    - **utils** - Directory to store files that contain logics and are not screens or components.

  - **metrics.js** - File with metrics handled for various device types from your PixelRatio;

  - **index.js** - File where the themes will be indexed;

**index.js** - File responsible for centralizing the `src` directory code, in which routes are called just like any other configuration that needs to be executed at application startup, it is like an _Entry Point_ from the`src` directory;

**.editorconfig** - File for configuring the Plugin Editor Config, which standardizes some settings for the editor in different environments;

**.eslintrc.json** - ESLint configuration file, in it are inserted the rules and configurations of Linting of the project, such as the configuration of the Resolver for Babel Plugin Root Import and configuration of the global variable `__DEV__`;

**.prettier.json** - Prettier configuration file, in it are inserted the rules and configurations;

**.prettierignore** - Prettier ignore file, in it are inserted the files where we do not want the prettier to act;

**babel.config.js** - The Babel Plugin Root file is configured to accept absolute imports in the application using the `src` directory as the root;

**dependencies.json** - File containing only one object with list of dependencies that should be installed in the application, it is worth remembering that the dependencies that already come by default in the project as `react` and`react-native` need not be in this list, unless you want manage the version of these libs;

**devDependencies.json** - File containing only one object with list of development dependencies that should be installed in the application, it is worth remembering that development dependencies that already come by default in the project like `@ babel / core`,`eslint`, among others, do not need be on this list, unless you want to manage the version of these libs;

**index.js** - Application root file, also called _Entry Point_, is the first file called at the time of the build and execution of the application, in it is called the file `src / index.js` which in turn calls the routes of the application;

**jsconfig.json** - Javascript configuration file in the Editor, it is responsible for activating the Auto Complete of Javascript codes in the application;

**package.json** - Unlike common projects, this file has the necessary settings for publishing the Template in NPM, to know more about it see the section below;

### Installation

1. To install and use this template the process is very simple, just create a new project using the command:

```sh
react-native init AwesomeExample --template nigg
```

2. After the project you created you can delete the `App.js` file (running this command in the project root:`rm ./App.js`) from the root, because the `index.js` file now points to the folder **src**.

This will create the project with all dependencies of the template properly installed and linked, just like the configuration files that are copied to the project ðŸ˜„.

#### Additional step on Android

In order for the gestures to be enabled in Android, it is a simple step to open the `android / app / src / main / java / <project_package> / MainActivity.java` file, and start importing the packages as below:

```java
// ...
import com.facebook.react.ReactActivity;
// Added Imports
import com.facebook.react.ReactActivityDelegate;
import com.facebook.react.ReactRootView;
import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView;
```

Once the import is done we will create a new method, just below `getMainComponentName ()`, where:

```java
public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
  @Override
  protected String getMainComponentName() { ... }
  // Added Method
  @Override
  protected ReactActivityDelegate createReactActivityDelegate() {
    return new ReactActivityDelegate(this, getMainComponentName()) {
      @Override
      protected ReactRootView createRootView() {
        return new RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView(MainActivity.this);
      }
    };
  }
}
```
